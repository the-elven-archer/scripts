--- Rackspace management scripts ---
This scripts were made to launch and check servers in a Rackspace ServerCloud environment.
You must check the next prerequisites:
-	cURL
-	The file /root/.rackspace/login with the next content:
<LOGINUSER>	<APIKEY>

Remember to make "0600" the .rackspace folder

You must run rs_get_credentials.sh before start working. This will download the temporary Admin URL and key in a file inside .rackspace
This credentials expire every 24 Hs.
